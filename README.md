###SOFTWARE USED
- CentOS  
- MySQL Server Version 5.1.71  
- PHP Version 5.3.3  
- Apache Version 2.2.15  
- Memcached  
- php-pecl-memcache (not php-pecl-memcached)  

###INSTALLATION
- Extract the contents of the WWW folder to a specified directory on the web host.  
- Edit /func/config.php and enter the Database information (DB Name, Credentials, etc.).  
- Point web browser to the site (check to make sure the index file loads).  
- If the main page loads, then open /restr/setup.php (from the browser) and enter the default login.  
  - This will setup the database for use.  
- Begin adding computers by pointing to /admin and loggin in from there.  
  - Go to Computers -> Register and fill out the web registration form (for each computer).  
  - Each computer must also have the client installed, and run at USER LOGIN (this must be configured).  
- When running the client, the IP Address of the SERVER must be specified in the vbs script.

###REMOVAL
- Remove the client files from each computer and deregister it as a login item.  
- The database can be dropped (manually), and the contents from the WWW directory can just be deleted.  

###NOTES
- I use phpMyAdmin for administration beyond what the web interface provides, however I DO NOT package this.  
  - This is a separate download, even though there is a link to it in the Admin Console.  
- In the demo, all are running on the same server (Linux, PHP, Apache, MySQL, memcached, php-pecl-memcache)  
  - These functions can be disributed, but must be configured accordingly (memcached is great with this).  
- I have recreated this on a virtual machine using the software noted above and have gotten this to work with basic configurations. The server configuration is completely up to the server admin, however the software above is necessary for this platform to run (Apache, MySQL, Memcache, etc.).
